## TbVolScroll

Simple (and ugly written) utility to enable volume control when your mouse cursor is positioned above the taskbar.

Hold the left <kbd>ALT</kbd> key to enable precise volume control (decrease/increase volume by 1%). Standard volume step is 5%.

The volume bar will follow the cursor when it's moved. If the volume is lower than 10% precise volume control is automatically enabled.

In the tray icon menu a few additional settings can be found to change.

## Known problems

- Scrolling isn't detected when certain windows have focus (e.g. Task Manager)
